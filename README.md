## Instruction

Using the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers), you're to create a mini unsplash clone using the mockup given.

### Expected Features

1. Users should see a landing with latest african pictures
2. Users can make a search
3. Users should see a skeletal loader while waiting for results
4. Users can click on an image and see a modal showing a higher resolution.

### Added Extras

1. A toggle to switch between light and dark mode.
   Reason: I have grown accustomed to dark colors. The initial styling was dependent on OS setting for dark mode but someone viewing this might want the option to switch irrespective of OS setting.

2. A close button, so a user can reveal the search field without refreshing the page.

3. If a user makes a search that returns no result, a close button that refreshes the page.

## Project setup

- `npm install`
- `npm run serve`

You can then visit the app in-browser; it defaults to http://localhost:8080
